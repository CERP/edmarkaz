					Ilm Exchange is a digital education platform that connects schools,
					teachers and students with affordable resources to enable quality
					teaching and learning across Pakistan. Our long-term vision is to become
					Pakistan’s premier education hub that brings together stakeholders across
					the education ecosystem — from school leaders to service providers and
					financers to researchers and policymakers. Our underlying goal is to nurture
					innovation and improve education quality at the system level.
				</div>
				<div className="para white">
					Ilm Exchange has been created by a part of the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://epod.cid.harvard.edu/initiative/leaps-program&sa=D&ust=1586116228054000&usg=AFQjCNFgHnauCjI1el6pNHmk9r9mjUAkqw" target="__blank">LEAPS</a> (Learning and Educational Achievements in
					Pakistan Schools) team at the Centre for Economic Research in Pakistan (<a href="https://www.cerp.org.pk/" target="__blank">CERP</a>).
					The project is built on findings from two decades of rigorous empirical <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://epod.cid.harvard.edu/initiative/leaps-program&sa=D&ust=1586116228054000&usg=AFQjCNFgHnauCjI1el6pNHmk9r9mjUAkqw" target="__blank">research</a>

				</div>
				<div className="para white">
					In response to the Covid-19 pandemic that has forced schools to close,
					we have worked with schools, education technology partners and content
					creators to curate a library of digital resources so that students can
					continue learning from home. Whether you prefer learning in Urdu or English,
					we bring you fun, engaging content through video lessons, games and quizzes.
					We encourage you to use this content and give us feedback through our discussion
					forum.
				</div>
				<div className="para white">
					We are working towards becoming a trusted partner to an active community
					of over 100,000 schools that explore innovative products and services,
					engage in dialogue about best practices and share knowledge and experiences
					to learn from one another and grow as a sector. Together with innovators and
					dedicated education support providers, we dream of a bright future for the
					children of Pakistan.
