	<h1> 8 Kinds of Intelligence </h1>
	
	<p>Humans are not computers: they do not run on a single machine. Rather, our minds are like many computers, made up of many different machines. Some of these computers can be stronger than others. </p>
	<p>Teachers need to be aware that students can be intelligent in different ways. Teachers can improve student learning by using different methods to explain content and deliver lessons.
		At the same time, giving students an opportunity to present what they have learned provides teachers with more understanding of how to cater to students’ particular intelligences.</p>
	
	<p>This idea was first put forward by Howard Gardner, a professor at Harvard University, who said that people have eight kinds of intelligences. This idea is referred to as “the theory of <b> multiple intelligences</b>"". These “multiple intelligences” are:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li> <b> Visual-Spatial Intelligence</b></li>
		<p>
		Students who have visual-spatial intelligence are good at visualizing things, or imagining and forming pictures in their mind. They are good at reading maps, and making charts or pictures. They enjoy reading, writing, drawing and painting, and are good at doing puzzles. 
		</p>
		<p>How can teachers encourage students with visual-spatial intelligence? </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Use puppets to act out concepts learned in class</li>
			<li>Use pictorial models such as flow charts, visual maps, and Venn diagrams to display new material</li>
		</ul>

		/>

		<li><b> Linguistic-Verbal Intelligence</b></li>
		<p>Students who have linguistic-verbal intelligence are good at using words, both to speak and to write. They are good at remembering information and at debating. They are also able to explain things well.</p>
		<p>How can teachers encourage students with linguistic-verbal intelligence?</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Ask them to tell a story related to the topic being covered in class </li>
			<li>Have them participate in debates where they have to argue to defend their point of view</li>
		</ul>

		/>

		<li><b> Logical-Mathematical Intelligence </b></li>
		<p>Students who have logical-mathematical intelligence are good at solving problems, seeing patterns, and thinking in logical ways, especially about numbers. They are good at solving problems and conducting science experiments.</p>
		<p>How can a teacher encourage a student with logical-mathematical intelligence?</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Play math games like Ludo with younger students, or chess and Monopoly with older students</li>
			<li>Have students search for patterns in the classroom, school building, or playground, especially to illustrate geometry concepts, like shapes and angles</li>
		</ul>

		/>

		<li><b> Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence</b></li>
		<p>Students who have bodily-kinesthetic  intelligence are good at moving their body and have physical control over their body. They are good at dancing and at sports, and are also good at making things with their hands. They remember things by doing them, rather than by hearing or seeing things. </p>
		<p>How can teachers encourage students with bodily-kinesthetic intelligence?</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Organize scavenger hunts, so that students can move around the classroom or the school to search for items related to a unit or a theme  </li>
			<li>Have students “act out” concepts. For example, when studying the solar system, have students act as planets by circling around another student acting as the sun.  </li>
		</ul>

		<li><b> Musical Intelligence </b></li>
		<p>Students who have musical intelligence are good at thinking in patterns, rhythms and sounds. They are good at remembering songs and melodies. They enjoy singing and playing musical instruments.</p>
		<p>How can teachers encourage students with musical intelligence? </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Use rhythm and clapping to memorize math facts </li>
			<li>Have students write their own songs about topics covered in class </li>
		</ul>
