		<h1>Strong Leaders Make Great Schools </h1>

		<p>School leaders are critical in developing high quality schools. If each school leader is responsible for creating a school where the learning environment is rich, then the educational system as a whole can be transformed, and with it so can the future of a nation</p>
		<p>Research shows that school leaders have a huge impact on student learning: studies have found that a single school principal can account for up to 25% of the impact that schools have on student learning and test scores. Changes in the practices of school principals can make a big difference in how much students learn and good schools generally have great school leaders.</p>
		

		<p>The world is changing everyday, faster than ever before. As a result, we need to preparing our children for a future that we may not even be able to predict. They will need skills that will equip them for life in the 21st century, commonly referred to as “21st-Century Skills”.</p>
		<p>Sadly, most of our schools are not teaching these skills. Of the 16 skills in the diagram below, most schools in Pakistan only cover the first three: literacy (English & Urdu), numeracy (Math), and scientific literacy (Science). But there are 13 other critical skills that we need to start teaching our children. </p>
		
		<h5>What roles can school leaders play to improve their schools?</h5>

		<ol>
			<li><b> Setting Direction and Defining Goals </b></li>
			<p>School leaders need to decide what the focus of their school will be and what are their goals. They need to define these and communicate them to teachers and staff, as well as to parents and even students. It is up to the school leader to constantly remind the school community of these goals and make sure that they are being met. </p>
			<p>School Leaders can start setting the direction for their school by making a School Improvement Plan, which lays out their goals for the year.</p>

			<li><b>Developing People</b></li>
			<p>A school is only as effective as its teachers. It is the school leader’s job to ensure that teachers have content-knowledge as well as knowledge of pedagogy, or the instructional practices and teaching methods required for different subjects and age groups. Teachers need to be trained, coached, fully supported, and have opportunities to collaborate with each other and the administration to develop the knowledge and skills they need to meet the school’s goals. School leaders also need to monitor and evaluate teachers, to give them feedback in a positive manner on how to improve. School leaders are responsible for providing teachers with the resources and guidance they need to meet the school’s goals. </p>

			<li><b>Creating an Enabling Environment and Positive Culture</b></li>
			<p>The school leader needs to create systems so that the school functions well. This includes building relationships by being accessible to teachers, staff, and students.  It also includes motivating teachers so that they love their jobs and want to do better, and setting up processes that help everyone achieve the school’s goals. This helps create a culture where everyone cooperates and works together towards the same goals. The school culture becomes positive and supportive, not negative or complacent. Students and teachers both benefit from a positive school culture where they feel valued and cared for. This motivates them to work harder and try and do better. </p>

		</ol>
		<p>By building a system with clear goals, providing lots of support, and being organized, a school leader can impact student achievement by enhancing teacher capability and motivation. In the end, a school is effective not only when it is producing good results, but when everyone who is part of the system is happy to be present. </p>
