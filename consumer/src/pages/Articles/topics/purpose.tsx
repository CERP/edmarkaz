	<h1>What is the Purpose of School?</h1>

	<p>Look at this picture: does it seem like a good classroom to you? It was created by the French artist Jean-Marc Côté over 100 years ago (in 1899), when he was asked to draw what the world would look like in the year 2000. The students are listening to and processing information, but they do not look interested or excited by what they are learning. They are also not interacting with the teacher or with each other. This picture was drawn to show what a classroom might look like in the future, but what it really shows us today is how little classrooms have evolved. </p>

	<p>If we look at the timeline of human history, schools are a relatively recent invention. Humans lived as hunter-gatherers for hundreds of thousands of years, learning through exploration. It was the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century that created the need for schooling — but this was a very particular kind of schooling. Schools were built to produce workers for the factory floor: workers who would show up on time and follow instructions. Structured classrooms, where students sat at one desk for the entire day, were good preparation for the industrial workforce. However, even though the industrial age is far behind us, many schools still function the way schools used to 200 years ago. </p>

	<p><b>So what is the purpose of a school today? Three commonly accepted core purposes of education are:</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Personal: education should enable students to engage with their thoughts and emotions, and be able to make informed decisions to be able to lead better quality lives;</li>
		<li>Social: education should enable students to engage with the world around them and become active, responsible, compassionate and tolerant citizens in their communities; </li>
		<li>Economic: education should enable students to become a part of the national/global workforce and be financially independent.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>As you can see, preparing students for the workforce is only one aspect of education. Schools are centers for building a community just as much as they are a centers of learning. From an early age, going to school allows students to meet others who are different from them. This exposure is critical to develop social skills and a wider view of society and the world. </p>

	<p>
		But there is another purpose of education, in addition to preparing students for life. It is preparing students to be lifelong learners. It is no longer enough to just teach students a limited number of subjects. The world is always creating new information and knowledge, and students need to know how to continue learning on their own so that they can update their knowledge base throughout their lives.
		</p>

	<h2>So how can schools prepare students to become lifelong learners?</h2>

	<p>After providing students with the basic concepts functional skills in every subject, teachers need to train them to apply this knowledge. Learning how to apply knowledge is a critical step towards becoming an independent learner. Once you know how to process information, you can process any new information that comes your way. A helpful tool teachers can use towards this end is Bloom’s Taxonomy. This was developed by the educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom in 1956 and is used by teachers all around the world. </p>

	<ol>
		<li>Remember: Students learn basic concepts [e.g. definition of a noun, times tables]</li>

		<li>Understand: Students organize and summarize information in order to understand it [e.g. understand that a person’s name is a noun, and multiplication is repeated addition]</li>

		<li>Apply: Students use the information they remember and have understood to solve a problem or design a solution [e.g. can make sentences with words and solve math problems] </li>
		<li>Analyze: Students analyze the problem they applied information to and try to figure out whether their reasoning was correct [e.g. students can review their own work or other’s work to see if it makes sense] </li>
		<li>Evaluate: Students think of other possibilities to the problem, make interpretations, and propose alternatives [e.g. can see if there are other ways of approaching a problem] </li>
		<li>Create: Students propose or build a new solution based on their process of analysis and evaluation [e.g. write their own thoughts, design their own projects] </li>

	</ol>

	<p>Bloom’s Taxonomy can be applied to every subject. If you think about how learning happens in most classrooms in Pakistan, it usually ends at the first stage. Students memorize passages, formulas, and equations, without following the five further stages of understanding the material, applying, analyzing, and evaluating it, before using what they have learned to create their own interpretation of the content area. </p>


	<p>The purpose of education is not simply to know whatever already it exists: it is to learn about what does exist and use that knowledge to build further knowledge. It is also to learn how to do this with other people and for other people, to build a more just society, and a more peaceful planet. </p>
