		<h1>What Makes a School Great? </h1>

		<ol>
			<li><b>Strong Leadership</b></li>
			<p>A good principal is one of the most important parts of a good school. Their job is to make sure that everyone who is part of the school community is working towards the shared goal of making the school a safe and happy environment where all students are encouraged to do their best. </p>
			<h5> <i> How can you be a strong leader in your school? </i></h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Have regular meetings with teachers, so that they have an opportunity to share their concerns with you. These meetings will give teachers a chance to get to know you and to raise concerns they might have or issues that they might be struggling with. Knowing that you are available to listen and to help will build trust, and create a culture in your school where everybody listens and helps each other. </li>
			</ul>

			<br/>

			<li><b>Clear Mission and Goals </b></li>
			<p>A good school has a clear mission, that is a list of goals that everybody understands. These goals can be related to teacher performance, student achievement, or even the school’s overall environment. However, once you develop your mission and goals, it is critical to explain them to everybody who is a part of the school community.</p>
			<h5><i>How can you develop a clear mission and goals for your school? </i></h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Think about the ideal student you want to produce. Do you want this student to excel academically or do you also want them to be somebody who will solve problems, treat others with kindness, and be a leader in their community? Build your school’s mission based on these values.</li>
			</ul>

			<br />
			
			<li><b>High Academic Standards</b></li>
			<p>Having high academic standards means more than just expecting good test results. It means believing that every child has the potential to grow, improve, and excel. It is the role of all the adults who are part of the school to hold every student to high standards. This communicates not only that the school has a culture of excellence, but that it treats all its students equally. </p>
			<h5><i>How can you implement high academic standards in your school? </i></h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Encourage every teacher and staff member to have a “You can do it!” attitude. Remind them that their job is to constantly encourage every student, not only those who achieve good results. </li>
			</ul>

			<br />
			
			<li><b>Effective Teaching Methods</b></li>
			<p>It’s not enough for a teacher to know their subject well. They have to be able to relate this subject knowledge to students in a way that allows them to understand it well. The best teachers find ways to entertain and engage students in different ways.</p>
			<h5><i>How can your teachers teach effectively? </i></h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Allow your teachers to teach some classes collaboratively. Having two teachers in the same room will give them a chance to exchange ideas and to give each other feedback. Collaborative teaching is a great way for teachers to exchange effective teaching methods.</li>
			</ul>

			<br/>

			<li><b>Time and Opportunities to Learn</b></li>
			<p>Instruction time is the time dedicated to classes during the school day. In most school timetables, each subject is allocated an hour. This is often a short window of time and does not allow room for students to think about what they have just learned. Teachers need to be aware that there are many opportunities for students to learn during the school day, even if they are not being taught</p>
			<h5><i>How can you create more opportunities to learn in your school?</i></h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Give each student a journal and allow them to write in it for 10-15 minutes at the start of each day, perhaps while teaches are taking attendance. You can inform all teachers about this initiative so that they can ask students to write about open-ended questions related to their lessons. This way, students have a space where they can explore their curiosity.</li>
			</ul>

			<br/>

			<li><b>Monitoring Student Progress</b></li>
			<p>Student progress is not something you should measure only at the end of the term when report cards are filled. Teachers need to monitor student performance after each assessment, even if these are small assessments like quizzes and tests that lead up to exams. The point of monitoring performance is to keep track of each student’s learning journey. If a student who was performing well suddenly starts performing poorly, then a teacher should take steps to understand what has changed in that student’s life and provide that student with the resources they need to get back on track</p>
			<h5><i>How can you make sure teachers are monitoring student progress?</i></h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Create a system where teachers have to submit mid-term reports to the school administration, in addition to an end-of-term report. Request teachers to write a short  reflection on each student’s progress along with the report: this way you can see whether they are paying attention to the student’s needs and not just recording their marks on a sheet.</li>
			</ul>

			<br/>

			<li><b>Safe and Enabling Environment</b></li>
			<p>A safe environment is not created by boundary walls or security guards. It is created by having positive values, where bullying is unacceptable and where teachers make sure that every student feels accepted and loved.</p>
			<h5><i>How can you make your school safe?</i></h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Have a “zero-tolerance” policy for all forms of bullying. This means that bullying is simply unacceptable. Bullying includes physical, verbal, and emotional bullying. Teaches should be trained to be sensitive to the many ways in which children can make each other feel isolated, especially when it comes to making intoleranta and cruel comments about religious, ethnic, or class differences</li>
			</ul>

			<br/>

			<li><b>Good Parent-School Relations</b></li>
			<p>Parents are an essential part of any school’s community. Building good relationships with parents is a constant process. Think of creative ways to keep parents informed about what is happening at school: from a WhatsApp group or a Facebook page where updates are shared, or a newsletter that is printed with information and photos and sent out every few months.</p>
			<h5><i>How can you build good parent-school relations?</i></h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Host events for parents! Give them more chances to visit and spend time in the school than just parent-teacher meetings. Host “open days” where you display students’ work in the classrooms and where students prepare brief presentations. Parents will be excited to see what their children are learning day-to-day. </li>
			</ul>
