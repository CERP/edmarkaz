		<h1>How Can we Prepare Students for the Future? </h1>

		<p>The world is changing everyday, faster than ever before. As a result, we need to preparing our children for a future that we may not even be able to predict. They will need skills that will equip them for life in the 21st century, commonly referred to as “21st-Century Skills”.</p>
		<p>Sadly, most of our schools are not teaching these skills. Of the 16 skills in the diagram below, most schools in Pakistan only cover the first three: literacy (English & Urdu), numeracy (Math), and scientific literacy (Science). But there are 13 other critical skills that we need to start teaching our children. </p>
		

		<h3> Functional Literacies </h3>

		<ol>		
			<li><b>Literacy</b></li>
			<p>The ability to read and write well, and also to know how to learn more things and continue growing throughout life. </p>

			<li><b>Numeracy</b></li>
			<p>The ability to understand numbers and use Math. It is the first step to financial literacy, being able to manage money, and to solve many other problems.</p>

			<li><b>Scientific Literacy</b></li>
			<p>Children need to be able to understand how the world around them works. Knowledge of  Science can help students predict outcomes, take better care of themselves and their families and build a better quality of life as they grow up. </p>

			<li><b>ICT Literacy (Information and Communication Technologies)</b></li>
			<p>The Internet makes it possible to access a vast amount of information and we need to teach our students how to process all this information in order to find what they need. Schools need to teach students know how to research, organize, and communicate information, both online and offline. Given that there is so much false information online, it is equally critical to make sure that students know how to recognize when something might be false, so that nobody can take advantage of them. </p>

			<li><b>Financial Literacy</b></li>
			<p>Students need to know how to manage money. While math classes cover addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, they do not cover the background knowledge students need to make smart financial decisions throughout their lives. Every student, even before entering college or university, should know how to budget, save, and invest. They should also know things like how to get a loan, how to avoid debt, and how to file taxes. Knowing these can set a student up for a lifetime of success, by giving them the tools they need to manage money wisely early on. </p>

			<li><b>Cultural and Civic Literacy </b></li>
			<p>There is no society in the world that has overcome inequality and injustice. It is important for students to be aware of the problems facing the communities they live in, from environmental to economic and social problems. Students need to understand why these problems exist and what can be done to overcome them. For example, if they learn about different types of gases in science, they should also learn about the effects these gases have on our climate, the air we breathe and the crops we grow. Students should also become aware of how the government in their country works, as well as what their rights and duties are as good citizens. </p>
			
			<h3> Competencies </h3>
			
			<li><b>Critical Thinking & Problem-Solving </b></li>
			<p>Critical thinking is required to solve problems effectively. It is when we rely on reason and logic to evaluate an issue or a question and form our own judgement about it. The steps involved in this are thinking through different answers to a question and selecting one based on the evidence available. These are the steps we apply to solving problems also: first look at the problem from different angles, then come up with different solutions, and finally make a judgement about which solution fits best. This process is not part of most textbooks. Teachers will have to start practicing it in classroom themselves, by allowing students to ask questions, and asking students to consider different answers to problems, defend their opinions with examples, and think of potential solutions for problems in the real world. </p>

			<li><b>Creativity</b></li>
			<p>There are many ways to define creativity: it is the ability to see new things in the world, as well as the act of having imaginative ideas, and then turning them into reality. Creativity is more than just art, though drawing and painting help students appreciate beauty, pay attention to their surroundings, and express their feelings. Creativity is being able to think in new ways. This can be encouraged in classrooms by open-ended activities that are not graded, like keeping a daily journal, or by giving time to develop their own ideas and allowing them to make mistakes. </p>

			<li><b>Communication</b></li>
			<p>Students need to be able to communicate clearly and effectively. This means that they should be able to speak confidently and write persuasively. However, it also means that they need to listen carefully to others and make sure that they are responding in a way that is attentive and empathetic. Communication is, after all, a two-way street. </p>

			<li><b>Collaboration</b></li>
			<p>Nobody can change the world alone — we need to be able to work with other people, and this involves listening, understanding, and respecting other people’s ideas. Make students work in groups more often: have students solve problems together, create things together. Let them figure out how to complete assignments together, so that they learn how to divide responsibilities, how to resolve conflicts, and how to support and trust each other. </p>
			
			<h3> Character Qualities </h3>

			<li><b>Curiosity</b></li>
			<p>Given that information and knowledge are increasing fast, it is impossible for schools to teach students everything they need to know in every subject. Instead, schools need to prepare students to be lifelong learners through encouraging curiosity. Teachers can build curiosity in their students by constantly asking questions and by allowing students to make choices on what to study based on their interests. </p>

			<li><b>Initiative</b></li>
			<p>Initiative is the ability to take charge and do something independently. It is difficult for students to take initiative when they are not given a chance to be independent to begin with. Schools need to give students the opportunity to take initiative through starting their own after-school clubs, through working on school improvement projects with the school administration, and through completing long-term projects (for example, a community service project). </p>

			<li><b>Persistence / Grit </b></li>
			<p>Failure is part of problem-solving — students need to learn how to be resilient and learn from their failure. They need to know how to transform disappointment into curiosity and ask questions about their mistakes. This process of learning leads to personal growth and is an essential life skill.</p>

			<li><b>Adaptability</b></li>
			<p>One of the most valuable skills employers seek is adaptability: this means an ability to be flexible by learning quickly and becoming comfortable with new skills and in new positions. One way to encourage adaptability in school is encouraging students to try new things, even if these lie outside their comfort zone. </p>

			<li><b>Leadership</b></li>
			<p>Students should be encouraged, throughout their education, to be good leaders. Being a good leader doesn’t mean giving orders and making choices. It means understanding other people’s needs and experiences, and caring about them. Being a good leader does not mean having power, it means giving power. By building classrooms that celebrate care and collaboration, we can build better leaders.</p>

			<li><b>Social and Cultural Awareness </b></li>
			<p>Pakistan is a diverse country: we are surrounded by people who have different religious beliefs, belong to different religious sects, have different ethnic identities, and speak different languages. We need to celebrate this diversity by accepting and learning about different identities. Schools can encourage this by holding cultural events and festivals. </p>
